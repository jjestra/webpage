## Main Instructor

**ECON 101: Principles Of Microeconomics** -Spring 2021 

"like Prof. Estrada's commitment to students' success. He will go out of his way to ensure that the students are engaged with the material, understand the concepts, and are comfortable in the course. He sent out several surveys for feedback and many times will ask us for feedback in class on how the class is going and how he can make it better."

"Overall, I appreciated a lot how organized this class was. Having the learning objectives explained before starting each lecture made it clear which concepts would be helpful in our understanding of microeconomics. It also made more useful studying tools since you could review what you know with regard to each learning objective and see where you have any gaps in your understanding."
