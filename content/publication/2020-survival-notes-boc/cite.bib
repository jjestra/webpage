abstract={The efficient distribution of bank notes is a first‐order responsibility of
central banks. The authors study the distribution patterns of bank notes with
an administrative dataset from the Bank of Canada’s Currency Inventory
Management Strategy. The single note inspection procedure generates a
sample of 900 million bank notes in which the authors can trace the length
of the stay of a bank note in the market. The authors define the duration
of the bank note circulation cycle as beginning on the date the bank note
is first shipped by the Bank of Canada to a financial institution and ending
when it is returned to the Bank of Canada. In addition, the authors provide
information regarding where the bank note is shipped and later received,
as well as the physical fitness of the bank note upon return to the Bank of
Canada’s distribution centers. K–prototype clustering classifies bank notes
into types. A hazard model estimates the duration of bank note circulation
cycles based on their clusters and characteristics. An adaptive elastic net
provides an algorithm for dimension reduction. It is found that while the distribution of the duration is affected by fitness measures, their effects are
negligible when compared with the influence exerted by the clusters related to
bank note denominations.},
